# MTCNN: Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks for Face Detection and Alignment
MTCNN is a deep learning framework designed for real-time face detection and facial landmark localization.
It detects face bounding boxes and five key facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth corners) using a cascade of three neural networks.

# Applications of MTCNN:
Face detection in images and video
Face alignment as a preprocessing step for face recognition
Mobile and embedded vision systems
Surveillance, access control, and biometric security
Camera beautification and AR filter tracking

# Architecture Overview:
MTCNN consists of three stages. Each stage refines the output of the previous one.

Stage 1: P-Net (Proposal Network)
Function: Scans the input image at multiple scales to propose candidate face regions.
Outputs:
Face classification score
Bounding box regression
Features:
Works with image pyramid to detect faces of various sizes
Produces many rough bounding boxes

Stage 2: R-Net (Refine Network)
Function: Filters out false positives and refines bounding boxes from P-Net.
Outputs:
Refined face classification score
Improved bounding box regression
Features:
Discards low-confidence and overlapping boxes
Keeps higher-quality face candidates

Stage 3: O-Net (Output Network)
Function: Final bounding box refinement and facial landmark prediction
Outputs:
Final face classification score
Final bounding box regression
Five facial landmarks:
Left eye
Right eye
Nose
Left mouth corner
Right mouth corner
Features:
Outputs accurate face bounding boxes
Provides facial landmarks used for face alignment

# Pipeline Summary:
Resize input image to multiple scales
Use P-Net to propose initial face bounding boxes
Use R-Net to filter and refine boxes
Use O-Net to produce final bounding boxes and predict landmarks
Output includes face locations and five facial landmark positions
